				<h2>What is this?</h2>

				<p>From the prequel:</p>
				<p>
					"The Star Wars API is the world's first quantified and
					programmatically-formatted set of Star Wars data.
				</p>

				<p>
					After hours of watching films and trawling through content online, we
					present to you all the{" "}
					<strong>
						People, Films, Species, Starships, Vehicles and Planets
					</strong>{" "}
					from Star Wars.
				</p>

				<p>
					We've formatted this data in{" "}
					<a href="https://json.org">
						<strong>JSON</strong>
					</a>{" "}
					and exposed it to you in a{" "}
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">
						<strong>RESTish</strong>
					</a>{" "}
					implementation that allows you to programmatically collect and measure
					the data."
				</p>

				<p>
					I have replicated the original SWAPI platform, not only as a challenge
					for myself ( the{" "}
					<a
						href="https://github.com/phalt/swapi"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>
						{" "}
						Official SWAPI repository{" "}
					</a>{" "}
					takes you pretty far if you want a clone in Django), <br />
					but as a way to provide a standard API for my students without fear of
					it being taken down
				</p>

				<p>
					<a href="/docs">
						Check out the documentation to get started consuming swapi data
					</a>
				</p>

				<h2 id="what-happened">What happened to swapi.co?</h2>

				<p>
					Swapi.co?? Swapi.co.... That's a name I've not heard in a long time...
					A long time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortulately swapi.co is no longer maintained, and the service is
					currently down. This is a personalized branch of SWAPI that I have
					built to continue in assisting <br />
					my students (and others) with api comminucation. I will maintain it as
					much as possible.
				</p>

				<h2>What can you use this for?</h2>

				<p>
					Use SWAPI to fetch Star Wars universe data. This api is a fantastic
					educational resource.
				</p>
				<p>
					The original swapi had amazing helper libraries that I will steadily
					begin implenting. If you have one to contribute, or would like to
					contribute, feel free to contact me: inquiry@swapi.tech
				</p>

				<p>
					<em>Fetch people, planets, vehicles, and more.</em>:
				</p>

				<pre>
					<code>
						fetch('https://www.swapi.tech/api/planets/1')
						<br /> .then(res => res.json())
						<br /> .then(data => console.log(data))
						<br /> .catch(err => console.error(err);
						<br /> )
					</code>
				</pre>

				<h2>What are the features?</h2>
